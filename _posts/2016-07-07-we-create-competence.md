# We create competence.

We are your access point for a training and development resource offering both breadth and quality. The **Training Management Academy** (TMA) is our division which focuses on the competence development needs of Learning & Development professionals as well as HRD and Talent Management functions.

Our success is dependent on our ability to design and deliver the training solutions required by our Clients. We provide these solutions through our own full-time consultants and we also use independent consultants of equal experience and ability. Every member of the **Create Competence** network is actively developing new ideas and new approaches in new areas. The procedural restrictions of large consultancies are not allowed to constrict the potential of our creativity. 

However, this creativity is within the essential disciplines of quality, practicality and relevance. Our philosophy is one of partnership with our Clients, so the output is focused on **your** issues, **your** development objectives and the improvement of **your **staff performance.

Working in most market sectors we employ trainers who have significant business experience which helps to contribute to clients' learning that is firmly based around their workplace realities.

Create Competence has discreet working relationships with blue chip organizations where success has come from always adopting a flexible, client-centered approach to training solutions rather than simply adapting existing programs.
